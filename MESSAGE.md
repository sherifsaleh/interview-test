# Interview Test message
At first thank you, this test gave me a good chance to start learning about reactjs.

## Tasks and time
It took me some time, at first i have been preparing since our interview i have watched the documentation and did some tutorials i wanted to implement flux or redux at the beginning then i decided not.

### Task 1: 
Implement Paging Logic.
  - pagination application logic **Time spent : 2 hrs.** with some testing and code refactoring.
  - render pages **Time spent : 4 hrs.** stay synchronized with router and pagination it took some testing and refactoring.
  - set router **Time spent : 4 hrs.** to handling back button was tricky.

### Task 2:
Attach the required props to the "PriceHighlight. 
**Time spent : 5 mint.**

### Bonus Task:
Suggest a fix for the images *I found that product image are losing important details from specially the top and bottom areas when we the bg is set to cover. I'd have suggested to put image and picture tags inside of the figure tag and apply a responsive-image class. Keeping the image as background i replaced the cover property by contain property to display complete product images, cons: for some products it is very small that why i tried a quick fix on hover to show a zoomed version off the product image next to containing div* 
**Time spent : 15 mint.**
